### Info For Players
* The code displayed on this page is a constant work in progress by the many developers of this mod. If you choose to download the code from this page, be aware that you're getting the latest updates from all developers and that it's possible that bugs or issues may still be present. Knowing this, if you'd like to download the latest code, simply click the green "Clone or Download" button above and choose "Download ZIP". This will download the latest development override file to your PC, then you just install it like you normally would.
* If you'd like a copy of the latest release version of the mod, you can click "Releases" at the top of the page and download the latest mod release or previous releases if you so choose.
* If you have a bug report, the best place to let us know about it is the Discord channel, however you can also post on the forums on Steam (http://steamcommunity.com/app/541210/discussions/3/1353742967803190823) or Subsim (http://www.subsim.com/radioroom/showthread.php?t=231690) and we'll see it there as well.

### Info For Developers
* If you'd like to become a mod contributor, please contact CaptainX3 on the Discord channel located here: https://discord.gg/mMvpzSV
* Being a developer requires you to be on the Discord server. This is our primary method of communication.
* We'd like to keep this mod at the highest quality, so we ask and expect that all developers contribute work that is close to or equal to the original vanilla quality of the game. Substandard work will be rejected, and repeated issues will result in you being removed as a mod developer.
* When creating new units for the game, we use Wikipedia as our first choice for stats. If Wikipedia does not have stats available for your chosen unit, then you may seek alternative sources, however they must be at least credible enough to cite to the general public. **If Wikipedia has stats on your chosen unit, you are expected to use those unless you have a disputing credible source that you believe to be more correct than Wikipedia. Do not create units with stats "pulled out of the air."**
* Respect each other's work. If you didn't create something in the mod but you'd like to change it, talk to the original creator first if possible. It's rude to change others' work without asking.
