## Developer Announcements
_Important & urgent information for the mod developers will appear in this section._

* ### **URGENT: All developers need to keep their Github branches up to date! We are losing changes and reverting back to old versions of files way too often. Before beginning to work on your own files, make sure you use the Github Desktop App to Sync the latest files from the master branch!! THIS IS ABSOLUTELY VITAL!!**

* **When adding a new sub class to the mod, please also add it to the campaign files and the appropriate single mission files so that it's available for use by players. I can't continue to keep track of this alone. Please make sure you add your new class in the appropriate spot on the sub list (keep the same nations grouped together). These are the files that must be updated when a new class is added:**
  * override\campaign\campaign001\summary.txt
  * override\campaign\campaign002\summary.txt
  * override\campaign\campaign003\summary.txt
  * override\campaign\campaign004\summary.txt
  * override\campaign\campaign005\summary.txt
  * override\campaign\campaign006\summary.txt
  * Single Missions 1 & 2 - NATO Subs Only
  * Single Missions 3 & 4 - Russian Subs Only
  * Single Mission 5 - All Subs
  * Single Mission 8 - Russian SSBNs Only
  * Single Mission 9 - NATO SSBNs Only
  * Single Missions 10 thru 27 - All Subs
  * Single Mission 28 - ANY new units sections 1 and 3. All playable subs sections 1 and 2 and "campaign/maps/norwegian_sea_traffic.txt".
  * Single Mission 29 - NATO SSBNs Only (Must have working SLBMs!)
  * Single Mission 30 - Russian SSBNs Only (Must have working SLBMs!)
  * Single Mission 31 - ANY new units to be added to "campaign/maps/norwegian_sea_traffic.txt".
  * Single Mission 32 - ONLY Playable SHIPS. ANY new units to be added to "campaign/maps/norwegian_sea_traffic.txt".
  
  ##Any units are now to be added into the "campaign/maps/norwegian_sea_traffic.txt" file in the OtherVessels section (Vessel List order) so that they will appear in the in-game reference and sonar. Everything now pulls from this one file.

If you choose to download the code from this page, be aware that you're getting the latest updates from all developers and that it's possible that bugs or issues may still be present. Knowing this, if you'd like to download the latest code, simply click the green "Clone or Download" button above and choose "Download ZIP". This will download the latest development override file to your PC, then you just install it like you normally would.
* If you'd like a copy of the latest release version of the mod, you can click "Releases" at the top of the page and download the latest mod release or previous releases if you so choose.

### Info For Developers
* If you'd like to become a mod contributor, please contact CaptainX3 on the Discord channel located here: https://discord.gg/mMvpzSV
* Being a developer requires you to be on the Discord server. This is our primary method of communication.
* We'd like to keep this mod at the highest quality, so we ask and expect that all developers contribute work that is close to or equal to the original vanilla quality of the game. Substandard work will be rejected, and repeated issues will result in you being removed as a mod developer.
* When creating new units for the game, we use Wikipedia as our first choice for stats. If Wikipedia does not have stats available for your chosen unit, then you may seek alternative sources, however they must be at least credible enough to cite to the general public. **If Wikipedia has stats on your chosen unit, you are expected to use those unless you have a disputing credible source that you believe to be more correct than Wikipedia. Do not create units with stats "pulled out of the air."**
* Respect each other's work. If you didn't create something in the mod but you'd like to change it, talk to the original creator first if possible. It's rude to change others' work without asking.
