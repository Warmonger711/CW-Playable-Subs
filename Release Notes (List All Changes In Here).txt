Changed the incorrect USET-80 to UGST on the Typhoon VLS variant.

Fixed the missile strike single missions to have the correct color circle.

Changed the VLS launch depth on the Ohio from 100 to 300 like all other VLS subs.

Changed all of the campaigns so that only appropriate subs can be chosen... NATO subs for the NATO campaigns and Russian subs for the Russian campaigns.

Removed the "NEXT RELEASE DATE" text file, I don't think we really need it.

Added 9 new LAND STRIKE campaign missions for the 1984 campaign so that SSBNs can use their missiles to complete those missions.

Changed the briefing text for all LAND STRIKE missions so that the red text is now yellow, making it much easier to read.

Reverted all subs back to the default UI until the UI bug is addressed by the devs. (I still have backup copies of all HUD files)

Added the Type-091 Han, Type-093/93A/93B Shang with their weapons: Yu-3, Yu-6, CY-1 ASROC witht he Yu-7 torpedo, C-801 SSM, YJ-18 SSM and the CJ-10 LAM. Also added their sonars, the H/SQ2-262B and the H/SQC-207.
