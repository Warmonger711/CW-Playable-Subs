usn_an_bqr_2=AN/BQR-2=Derived from the German wartime GHG sonar suite as fitted on the Type XXI electroboot, the BQR-2 is a medium frequency sonar fitted to most USN subs until the Thresher/Permit class. Though adequate for its day, by the 1980's this system is woefully obsolete and nearly blind against all but the oldest Soviet boats.

usn_an_bqs_4=AN/BQS-4=This system formed the active component of the sonar suite on 1950's era USN subs. Unlike the BQR-2 though, it is still powerful enough to detect otherwise silent enemies.

usn_an_bqq_2=AN/BQQ-2=The first spherical integrated sonar array, mounted in the Permit- and Sturgeon class submarines.

usn_an_bqq_5=AN/BQQ-5=This advanced sonar suite uses a spherical array with the latest digital signal processing techniques and was first introduced in the Los Angeles-class fast attack submarines, and subsequently to the Permit and Sturgeon classes where it replaced the analog BQQ-2 spherical array.

usn_an_bqq_10=AN/BQQ-10=This next-generation replacement for the AN/BQQ-5 system uses more advanced algorithms and has significant capability over the previous version.

usn_bqr_25=BQR-25=The BQR-25 Towed Array greatly increases the range of passive sonar. It is most effective at slower speeds but suffers from noise saturation above 10 Kts.\n \nThe Towed Array also negates the stern blind arc that is caused by ownship noise.

usn_tb_16=TB-16=The TB-16 Towed Array greatly increases the range of passive sonar. It is most effective at slower speeds but suffers from noise saturation above 10 Kts.\n \nThe Towed Array also negates the stern blind arc that is caused by ownship noise.

usn_tb_23=TB-23=The TB-23 Towed Array is a significant increase over the usn_tb_16 array, but suffers from more noise saturation per knot than the previous version.

usn_tb_29=TB-29=The TB-29 Towed Array is the latest advancement in US towed array technology. Alongside better detection, it also slightly reduces the noise saturation per knot over the TB-23.

wp_pelamida=Pelamida=The latest and most advanced Russian towed sonar array, equipped only on the Akula class submarines.

wp_mgk540=MGK-540=A highly advanced Russian sonar suite, equipped only on the Akula class submarines. Roughly equivalent to the US BQQ-10 system.

wp_bull_horn=Bull Horn=This hull-mounted active/passive medium frequency set is mounted on later Soviet ships where it replaces the earlier Bull Nose medium frequency array.

wp_bull_nose=Bull Nose=This is a medium-frequency passive/active array dating from the late 1960's. Though incapable of detecting US subs at anything above medium ranges, this design was clearly regarded as a success by the Soviets who equipped it on almost every major class of anti-submarine ship during the 1970's.

wp_wolf_paw=Wolf Paw=This is an older medium frequency sonar set that equipped many surface ships before the introduction of Bull Nose.

wp_trout_cheek=Trout Cheek=This system was derived from the German wartime Balkongerat sonar fitted in the Type XXI. It is comparable to the BQR-2/BQS-4 suite fitted to the Skipjack.

wp_squid_arm=Squid Arm=This is an advanced low frequency sonar array unique to the Alfa-class fast attack submarine where it feeds a highly automated command-and-control system, the details of which little is known.

wp_shark_teeth=Shark Teeth=This cylindrical low frequency array is fitted on the Victor, Juliet, Tango and Charlie class submarines. It is comparable in performance to the US BQQ-2 and doubles the detection range compared to the earlier Trout Cheek MF array.

wp_shark_gill=Shark Gill=The latest generation of Soviet sonar systems, this cylindrical low frequency array is used on submarines where it equips the Victor III, Charlie II, Delta III and IV, Typhoon and Oscar classes. Compared to the earlier Shark Teeth, this set is better than the BQQ-2 of the early Permit- and Sturgeon classes, and almost comparable to the BBQ-5 that equips the latest US subs.\n \nIt is rumoured that an advanced version of this suite equips the Sierra-class submarine, but little is known at this time.

wp_buck_toe=Buck Toe=Definitely antiquated by 1980's standards, this is a searchlight-style high frequency active array, little better than WW2 active sonars.

wp_shark_fin=Shark Fin=This medium frequency set equips some Soviet boats of the late 1960's, where it forms the active component of the Shark Teeth passive suite.

wp_pike_jaw=Pike Jaw=This high frequency set is common among the late 1950's generation where it equips the Foxtrot and November class boats, generally in conjunction with Trout Cheek. It can therefore be assumed that Pike Jaw is likewise a derivative of German wartime designs.

wp_stag_ear=Stag Ear=This is a very old high frequency set that equips the Whiskey-class diesel subs.

wp_foal_tail=Foal Tail=This high frequency variable depth sonar (VDS) is a shipboard derivative of the dipping sonar mounted on the Ka-25 Hormone A anti-submarine helicopters. Commonly mounted on smaller patrol ships, the ability to search beneath the layer makes it a dangerous system to encounter in shallow waters.

wp_mare_tail=Mare Tail=This large variable depth sonar (VDS) was first observed on the Moskva-class helicopter cruisers, and later on the Kiev, Kara and Krivak classes where it provides these ships the ability to scan beneath the thermal layer when applying sprint-and-drift tactics.

wp_horse_tail=Horse Tail=Larger and much more capable than Mare Tail, Horse Tail is a towed low frequency variable depth sonar (VDS) which equips the Kirov and Udaloy classes where it gives these ships the ability to search beneath the layer for considerable distances.

wp_shark_tail=Shark Tail=This is a passive low-frequency towed array that equips all Soviet submarines of recent construction from the Victor III onwards. While not comparable to American towed array systems, it nevertheless provides the Soviets wih an improved sonar capability which earlier generations were lacking, giving these newer boats something of a quantum leap in capabilities and the threat they provide.

wp_horse_jaw=Horse Jaw=This is a follow-on to the Moose Jaw that equips the Kirov and Udaloy classes, and gives these ships tremendous capability against even silent US submarines.

wp_moose_jaw=Moose Jaw=This is a very large low-frequency array first observed on the Moskva's, but which also equips the Kiev class.

usn_an_sqs-56=AN/SQS-56=The AN/SQS-56 is a modern hull-mounted sonar which features digital implementation, system control by a built-in mini computer, and an advanced display system. Computer controlled functions provide a system that is extremely flexible and easy to operate. The computer is also used to provide automated fault detection and localization with a built-in training capability. The sonar is an active/passive, preformed beam, digital sonar providing panoramic echo ranging and panoramic (DIMUS) passive surveillance. A single operator can search, track, classify and designate multiple targets from the active system while simultaneously maintaining anti-torpedo surveillance on the passive display.

usn_an_sqs-53=AN/SQS-53=The Sonar Set AN/SQS-53C is a computer-controlled surface-ship sonar that has both active and passive operating capabilities providing precise information for ASW weapons control and guidance. The AN/SQS-53C is designed to perform direct path ASW search, detection, localization, and tracking from a hull mounted transducer array.

usn_an_sqr-19=AN/SQR-19=The AN/SQR-19 Tactical Towed Array SONAR (TACTAS) provides very long-range passive detection of enemy submarines. TACTAS is a long cable full of microphones that is towed about a mile behind the ship.

usn_an_sqs-26=AN/SQS-26=AN/SQS-26 was a United States Navy surface ship, bow mounted, low frequency, active/passive sonar developed by the Naval Underwater Sound Laboratory and built by General Electric and the EDO Corporation. At one point, it was installed on 87 US Navy warships from the 1960s to the 1990s and may still be in use on ships transferred to other navies.

usn_an_sqs-23=AN/SQS-23=The AN/SQS-23 was a long range, azimuth-scanning type of search and attack sonar used for search, search-analyze, attack-RDT, attack-SDT and hand-key applications.

usn_an_sqr-18=AN/SQR-18=The AN/SQR-18 series began with the SQR-18 Interim Escort Towed-Array Surveillance System (IETASS) that was developed to be a simpler version of the AN/ SQR-14/15 long-range towed arrays for frigates and minesweepers. During tests, the SQR-18 towed array generated excess noise, which contributed to its unreliability in the first convergence zone. Deployed on Belknap (CG 26)-class cruisers, Spruance (DD 963)-class destroyers, and Oliver Hazard Perry (FFG 7)-and Knox (FF 1052)-class frigates. Also fitted in Japanese destroyers and Indonesian Ahmed Yani-class frigates.

// USN SONOBUOYS

usn_asb=ASB=Active sonobuoys emit sound energy (pings) into the water and listen for the returning echo before transmitting information—usually range and bearing—via UHF/VHF radio to a receiving ship or aircraft. The original active sonobuoys pinged continuously after deployment for a predetermined period of time. Later, Command Activated Sonobuoy System (CASS) sonobuoys allowed the aircraft to trigger pings (or buoy scuttling) via a radio link. This evolved into DICASS (Directional CASS) in which the return echo contained bearing as well as range data.

usn_psb=PSB=Passive sonobuoys emit nothing into the water, but rather listen, waiting for sound waves (for instance, power plant, propeller or door-closing and other noises) from ships or submarines, or other acoustic signals of interest such as an aircraft's black box pinger, to reach the hydrophone. The sound is then transmitted via UHF/VHF radio to a receiving ship or aircraft.

// USN SURFACE SHIPS RADARS
usn_an_sps-49=AN/SPS-49=The AN/SPS-49 is a United States Navy two-dimensional, long range air search radar built by Raytheon that can provide contact bearing and range. It is a primary air-search radar for numerous ships in the U.S. fleet and in Spain, Poland, Taiwan aboard Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates, Canada on its Halifax-class frigates, New Zealand on its Anzac-class frigates and Australia on its Adelaide-class frigates and Anzac-class frigates. It formerly served in a complementary role aboard Aegis cruisers with the AN/SPY-1 but the systems are currently being removed during routine upgrade with no replacement.

usn_an_sps-55=AN/SPS-55=The AN/SPS-55 is a solid state surface search and navigation radar. It was developed by Cardion Electronics for the U.S. Navy under a contract awarded in 1971. It was originally developed for a class of ships known as Patrol Frigates, but it was also installed on numerous Cruisers, Destroyers and Minesweepers. It is an I band radar and its antenna consists of two waveguide slotted arrays mounted back-to-back.

usn_an_sps-10=AN/SPS-10=For decades, the AN/SPS-10 was the standard US Navy surface-search radar. Although considered a horizon-range navigation radar, it routinely detects targets at much greater ranges. Existing SPS-10's are being replaced by the solid-state SPS-67 that use the SPS-10′s parabolic cylinder open-mesh antenna.

// USN HELO RADARS

usn_aps-124=APS-124=Knowledge gained in the development of AN/APS-115/116 is used in the development of X-band AN/APS-124, the first model in the radar family developed for ASW helicopters. Due to the adoption of the traveling wave tube (TWT), the peak power is significantly increased to 350 kW. Due to the size and weight constraint, the parabolic antenna of radars for fixed aircraft is replaced by a 72-inch x 12 inch slotted planar array antenna for AN/APS-124, and scan rate is 6 or 12 rpm, with 120 rpm for weather. The array of AN/APS-124 produces a 1.2 x 20 degrees beam, and the typical range against a 1 square meter target is 16 nm in comparison to 20 nm of AN/APS-115/116. AN/APS-124 is installed on Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk.


usn_aps_115=APS-115=AN/APS-115 is a development of AN/APS-80A, and it is the first attempt of digitization by providing digital input into the digital combat system installed on the P-3. Other improvement over the original AN/APS-80 included the integration of two separate AN/APS-80A radar into a single unit via a single planar position indicator (PPI) display. The most important improvement is that AN/APS-115 is an automatic version of earlier AN/APS-80/80A, but some users felt that in the hands of an experienced operator, the manual analog AN/APS-80/80A has a better chance to detect small targets such as submarine periscope in sea clutter. AN/APS-115 utilizes cavity magnetron.
