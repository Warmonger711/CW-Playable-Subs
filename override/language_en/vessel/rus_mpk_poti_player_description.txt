History=<b>THIS IS A TEST UNIT, USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.\nPLEASE REPORT ANY ISSUES ON THE DISCORD MOD CHANNEL.</b>\n\nThese ships are predecessors of the more familiar Grisha class. They were among the first to feature a combined diesel/gas turbine (COGOG) propulsion system and were armed with the then latest sonar and weapons. They are reputed to be good sea boats and while limited in terms of sensors, the 6000 yard range of their anti-submarine rockets make them dangerous opponents to any sub caught at periscope depth.
