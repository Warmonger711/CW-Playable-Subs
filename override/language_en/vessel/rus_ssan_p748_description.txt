History=<b>THEORETICAL DESIGN</b>\nSelf Noise Rating: 155 db\nEscape Depth: 600 ft\n\nIn the late 1960s, Project 748 was proposed and actually nearly constructed. It was a nuclear-powered assault transport of 11,000 tons. This submarine was to carry up to 20 amphibious tanks and BTR-60P armored personnel carriers, and up to 470 troops, with the vehicles stored in double-deck hulls contained to both sides of the main hull, all three within an outer shell. The submarine was to be equipped with a torpedo armament of four bow 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes as well as anti-aircraft guns and surface-to-air missiles. It also was to have mine-laying capabilities. In the end, while the shipyards had already begun to prepare for the production of five submarines of the 748 type, this project was also scrapped in the early 1970s, as the manufacturing capacity was needed for new ballistic missile submarines.
