History=<b>THIS IS A TEST UNIT, USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.\nPLEASE REPORT ANY ISSUES ON THE DISCORD MOD CHANNEL.</b>\n\nThe Oliver Hazard Perry class is a class of guided missile frigates named after the American Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry, the hero of the naval Battle of Lake Erie. Also known as the Perry or FFG-7 class, the warships were designed in the United States in the mid-1970s as general-purpose escort vessels inexpensive enough to be bought in large quantities to replace World War II-era destroyers and complement 1960s-era Knox Class frigates. In Admiral Elmo Zumwalt's "high low fleet plan", the FFG-7s were the low capability ships with the Spruance Class destroyers serving as the high capability ships. Intended to protect amphibious landing forces, supply and replenishment groups, and merchant convoys from aircraft and submarines, they were also later part of battleship Centred surface action groups and aircraft carrier battle groups/strike groups.
